## Assessment of risk of diabetes using spatial dietary intake profile from NFHS-4 and NFHS-3 dataset

This project explores two problems: discovering a set of attributes that predicts risk of diabetes and analysing the influence of socio-economic indicator on risk of diabetes. The NFHS-4 and NFHS-3 data will be used in machine learning techniques and other advanced data analytics approaches for analysis.

This project is part of research project for Econ HSP511 : Economics lab at [IIT Delhi](https://hss.iitd.ac.in/economics) under the guidance of [Prof. Sourabh B Paul](https://hss.iitd.ac.in/faculty/sourabh-b-paul)
