## Assessment of risk of diabetes using spatial dietary intake profile from NFHS-4 and NFHS-3 dataset

This project explores two problems: discovering a set of attributes that predicts risk of diabetes and analysing the influence of socio-economic indicator on risk of diabetes. The NFHS-4 and NFHS-3 data will be used in machine learning techniques and other advanced data analytics approaches for analysis.

This project is a part of economics course HSP511 : Economics lab at [IIT Delhi](https://hss.iitd.ac.in/economics) under the guidance of [Prof. Sourabh B Paul](https://hss.iitd.ac.in/faculty/sourabh-b-paul)

## Attributes selection for prediction of diabetes 

Attributes used in Machine learning for diabetes prediction 
1. preganancies
2. glucose
3. Blood pressure 
4. Skin Thickness - NFHS not available 
5. Insulin - NFHS not available 
6. BMI 
7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction - based upon family history - (doubtful)
8. Age
