"""
Our p-value of 0.45 is larger than 0.05, so we cannot reject our null hypothesis and 
we cannot accept our alternative. Even though the three sample means are different, we 
do not have a statistically significant difference. This means that with the observed data, 
there is not enough evidence to assume a general difference in delivery times of the three 
pizza companies

In our data, one pizza company was faster on average, but thanks to ANOVA we realize that 
this difference is not significant: we donâ€™t have enough proof to conclude that one company 
is faster in general.

This perfectly illustrates the goal of statistical inference: telling whether an observed 
difference is significant or not.
